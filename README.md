# Newton's Method
# Newton's Method Flask Application

## Requirements

To run this Flask application, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

- Flask
- NumPy
- SymPy

You can install these packages using pip. It is recommended to create a virtual environment before installing the dependencies. To set up your environment, you can follow these steps:

### Setup Instructions

1. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   
2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask numpy sympy
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the application**:
   Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Dependencies

- **Flask**: A micro web framework for Python.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computing in Python.
- **SymPy**: A library for symbolic mathematics in Python.

Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.

## Description
This project is a group assignment focused on implementing **Newton's Method** for numerical analysis. It was developed as part of a course requirement under the guidance of our instructor.

## Features
- **Implementation of Newton's Method**: Efficiently finds roots of real-valued functions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for ease of use.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures user inputs are correct and meaningful.
- **Error Handling**: Manages exceptions and provides user feedback.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hubcosc/Newton-s_Method.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Newton-s_Method
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies (if applicable)**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the application, use the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
Replace `main.py` with the appropriate entry point of your application if different.
