# Newton's Method

## Description
This project is a group assignment focused on implementing **Newton's Method** for numerical analysis. It was developed as part of a course requirement under the guidance of our instructor.

## Features
- **Implementation of Newton's Method**: Efficiently finds roots of real-valued functions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for ease of use.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures user inputs are correct and meaningful.
- **Error Handling**: Manages exceptions and provides user feedback.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hubcosc/Newton-s_Method.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Newton-s_Method
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies (if applicable)**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the application, use the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
Replace `main.py` with the appropriate entry point of your application if different.
